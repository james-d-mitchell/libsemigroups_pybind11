For computing finite index right congruences of a finitely presented semigroup or monoid.

Defined in ``sims.hpp``.On this page we describe the functionality relating to the small index congruence algorithm for 1-sided congruences. The algorithm implemented by this class is essentially the low index subgroup algorithm for finitely presented groups described in Section 5.6 of`Computation with Finitely Presented Groups <https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511574702>`_ by C. Sims. The low index subgroups algorithm was adapted for semigroups and monoids by R. Cirpons, J. D. Mitchell, and M. Tsalakou; see Anagnostopoulou-Merkouri2023aaThe purpose of this class is to provide the functions :any:`cbegin` , :any:`cend` , :any:`for_each` , and :any:`find_if` which permit iterating through the one-sided congruences of a semigroup or monoid defined by a presentation containing (a possibly empty) set of pairs and with at most a given number of classes.

For pruning the search tree when looking for congruences arising from right or two-sided congruences representing faithful actions.

Defined in ``sims.hpp``.This class provides a pruner for pruning the search tree when looking for right congruences representing faithful actions. A right congruence represents a faithful action if and only if it does not contain any non-trivial two-sided congruence. Equivalently, a word graph of a right congruence represents a faithful action if and only if there is no nontrivial pair of words :math:`(u, v)` such that every vertex of the word graph is compatible with :math:`(u, v)`.
